          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-300 text-justify">My fascination with technology began early, sparked by a curiosity for how things work. This led me to pursue Electronics and Communication Engineering, where I discovered my passion for embedded systems and hardware design. I thrived on turning theoretical concepts into real-world applications, from IoT devices to fault-tolerant computing architectures.</p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-base text-justify">As I deepened my knowledge, I ventured into AI and machine learning, developing systems like real-time emotion recognition using deep learning. Each project taught me the power of interdisciplinary thinkingâ€”blending hardware efficiency with software intelligence. Today, I stand at the intersection of innovation and practicality, driven by challenges that demand creative problem-solving.</p>
